<h3>Changes in version 2.0-3</h3>




<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Added new nestedness functions <code>nestedbetasor</code> and
<code>nestedbetajac</code> that implement multiple-site dissimilarity
indices and their decomposition into turnover and nestedness
components following Baselga (<EM>Global Ecology and
Biogeography</EM> 19, 134&ndash;143; 2010).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added function <code>rarecurve</code> to draw rarefaction curves
for each row (sampling unit) of the input data, optionally with
lines showing rarefied species richness with given sample size
for each curve.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added function <code>simper</code> that implements
&ldquo;similarity percentages&rdquo; of Clarke (<EM>Australian
Journal of Ecology</EM> 18, 117&ndash;143; 1993).  The method compares
two or more groups and decomposes the average between-group
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to contributions by individual
species.  The code was developed in 
<a href="https://github.com/jarioksa/vegan">GitHub</a>
by Eduard Szöcz (Uni Landau, Germany).
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>betadisper()</code> failed when the <code>groups</code> was a
factor with empty levels.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some constrained ordination methods and their support
functions are more robust in border cases (completely aliased
effects, saturated models, user requests for non-existng scores
etc). Concerns <code>capscale</code>, <code>ordistep</code>, <code>varpart</code>,
<code>plot</code> function for constrained ordination, and
<code>anova(&lt;cca.object&gt;, by = "margin")</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>scores</code> function for <code>monoMDS</code> did not
honour <code>choices</code> argument and hence dimensions could not be
chosen in <code>plot</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The default <code>scores</code> method failed if the number of
requested axes was higher than the ordination object had.  This
was reported as an error in <code>ordiplot</code> in
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2012-February/002768.html">R-sig-ecology</a> mailing list.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> argument <code>noshare = 0</code> is now
regarded as a numeric threshold that always triggers extended
dissimilarities (<code>stepacross</code>), instead of being treated
as synonymous with <code>noshare = FALSE</code> which always
suppresses extended dissimilarities.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Nestedness discrepancy index <code>nesteddisc</code> gained a
new argument that allows user to set the number of iterations
in optimizing the index.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oecosimu</code> displays the mean of simulations and
describes alternative hypothesis more clearly in the printed
output. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Implemented adjusted <i>R-squared</i> for partial
RDA. For partial model <code>rda(Y ~ X1 + Condition(X2))</code> this
is the same as the component <code>[a] = X1|X2</code> in variance
partition in <code>varpart</code> and describes the marginal (unique)
effect of constraining term to adjusted <i>R-squared</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added Cao dissimilarity (CYd) as a new dissimilarity
method in <code>vegdist</code> following Cao et al., <EM>Water
Envir Res</EM> 69, 95&ndash;106 (1997). The index should be good for
data with high beta diversity and variable sampling
intensity. Thanks to consultation to Yong Cao (Univ Illinois,
USA).
</p>
</ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-2</h3>




<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>capscale</code> failed if constrained component
had zero rank. This happened most likely in partial models when
the conditions aliased constraints. The problem was observed in
<code>anova(..., by ="margin")</code> which uses partial models to
analyses the marginal effects, and was reported in an email
message to
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-October/293077.html">R-News
mailing list</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stressplot</code> and <code>goodness</code> sometimes failed when
<code>metaMDS</code> was based on <code>isoMDS</code> (<span class="pkg">MASS</span> package)
because <code>metaMDSdist</code> did not use the same defaults for
step-across (extended) dissimilarities as <code>metaMDS(...,
     engine = "isoMDS")</code>. The change of defaults can also influence
triggering of step-across in <code>capscale(..., metaMDSdist =
     TRUE)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code> contained a minor bug resulting from
incomplete implementation of a speed-up that did not affect the
results. In fixing this bug, a further bug was identified in
transposing the hat matrices. This second bug was only active
following fixing of the first bug. In fixing both bugs, a
speed-up in the internal f.test() function is fully
realised. Reported by Nicholas Lewin-Koh.
</p>
</ul>

  


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>ordiarrows</code> and <code>ordisegments</code> gained argument
<code>order.by</code> that gives a variable to sort points within
<code>groups</code>. Earlier the points were assumed to be in order.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>ordispider</code> invisibly returns the
coordinates to which the points were connected.  Typically these
are class centroids of each point, but for constrained ordination
with no <code>groups</code> they are the LC scores.
</p>
</ul>
		 
  


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-1</h3>




<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>clamtest</code>: new function to classify species as
generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats (CLAM test of
Chazdon et al., <EM>Ecology</EM> 92, 1332&ndash;1343; 2011).  The test is
based on multinomial distribution of individuals in two habitat
types or sampling units, and it is applicable only to count data
with no over-dispersion.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as.preston</code> gained <code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code>
methods, and <code>as.fisher</code> gained <code>plot</code> method (which
also can add items to existing plots). These are similar as
<code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code> for <code>prestonfit</code> and
<code>fisherfit</code>, but display only data without the fitted lines.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>raupcrick</code>: new function to implement Raup-Crick
dissimilarity as a probability of number of co-occurring species
with occurrence probabilities proportional to species
frequencies.  <span class="pkg">Vegan</span> has Raup-Crick index as a choice in
<code>vegdist</code>, but that uses equal sampling probabilities for
species and analytic equations. The new <code>raupcrick</code>
function uses simulation with <code>oecosimu</code>. The function
follows Chase et al. (2011) <EM>Ecosphere</EM> 2:art24
[<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES10-00117.1">doi:10.1890/ES10-00117.1</a>],
and was developed with the consultation of Brian Inouye.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>meandist</code> could scramble items and give
wrong results, especially when the <code>grouping</code> was
numerical. The problem was reported by Dr Miguel Alvarez
(Univ. Bonn).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> did not reset <code>tries</code> when a new model
was started with a <code>previous.best</code> solution from a different
model. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>permatswap</code> for community null models using
quantitative swap never swapped items in a <i>2 by 2</i>
submatrix if all cells were filled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The result from <code>permutest.cca</code> could not be
<code>update</code>d because of a &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; issue.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 changed so that it does not accept using
<code>sd()</code> function for matrices (which was the behaviour at
least since <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 1.0-0), and several <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions were
changed to adapt to this change (<code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>,
<code>simulate</code> methods for <code>rda</code>, <code>cca</code> and
<code>capscale</code>). The change in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 does not influence the
results but you probably wish to upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span> to avoid
annoying warnings.
</p>
</ul>
	
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>nesteddisc</code> is slacker and hence faster when trying
to optimize the statistic for tied column frequencies. Tracing
showed that in most cases an improved ordering was found rather
early in tries, and the results are equally good in most cases.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-0</h3>




<h4>GENERAL</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Peter Minchin joins the <span class="pkg">vegan</span> team.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> implements standard <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo;. In
general, <code>S3</code> methods are not exported which means that you
cannot directly use or see contents of functions like
<code>cca.default</code>, <code>plot.cca</code> or <code>anova.ccabyterm</code>. To
use these functions you should rely on <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> delegation and simply
use <code>cca</code> and for its result objects use <code>plot</code> and
<code>anova</code> without suffix <code>.cca</code>. To see the contents of
the function you can use <code>:::</code>, such as
<code>vegan:::cca.default</code>. This change may break packages,
documents or scripts that rely on non-exported names.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> depends on the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This
package provides powerful tools for restricted permutation
schemes. All <span class="pkg">vegan</span> permutation will gradually move to use
<span class="pkg">permute</span>, but currently only <code>betadisper</code> uses the new
feature. 
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>monoMDS</code>: a new function for non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS). This function replaces
<code>MASS::isoMDS</code> as the default method in
<code>metaMDS</code>. Major advantages of <code>monoMDS</code> are that it
has &lsquo;weak&rsquo; (&lsquo;primary&rsquo;) tie treatment which means
that it can split tied observed dissimilarities.  &lsquo;Weak&rsquo;
tie treatment improves ordination of heterogeneous data sets,
because maximum dissimilarities of <i>1</i> can be split. In
addition to global NMDS, <code>monoMDS</code> can perform local and
hybrid NMDS and metric MDS.  It can also handle missing and zero
dissimilarities.  Moreover, <code>monoMDS</code> is faster than
previous alternatives. The function uses <code>Fortran</code> code
written by Peter Minchin.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>MDSrotate</code> a new function to replace
<code>metaMDSrotate</code>. This function can rotate both <code>metaMDS</code>
and <code>monoMDS</code> results so that the first axis is parallel to
an environmental vector.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>eventstar</code> finds the minimum of the evenness profile
on the Tsallis entropy, and uses this to find the corresponding
values of diversity, evenness and numbers equivalent following
Mendes et al. (<EM>Ecography</EM> 31, 450-456; 2008). The code was
contributed by Eduardo Ribeira Cunha and Heloisa Beatriz Antoniazi
Evangelista and adapted to <span class="pkg">vegan</span> by Peter Solymos.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitspecaccum</code> fits non-linear regression models to
the species accumulation results from <code>specaccum</code>. The
function can use new self-starting species accumulation models
in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> or other self-starting non-linear regression
models in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>. The function can fit Arrhenius, Gleason, Gitay,
Lomolino (in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>), asymptotic, Gompertz,
Michaelis-Menten, logistic and Weibull (in base <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>) models. The
function has <code>plot</code> and <code>predict</code> methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Self-starting non-linear species accumulation models
<code>SSarrhenius</code>, <code>SSgleason</code>, <code>SSgitay</code> and
<code>SSlomolino</code>. These can be used with <code>fitspecaccum</code> or
directly in non-linear regression with <code>nls</code>. These functions
were implemented because they were found good for species-area
models by Dengler (<EM>J. Biogeogr.</EM> 36, 728-744; 2009).
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>meandist</code> and
<code>mrpp</code> warn on negative dissimilarities, and
<code>betadisper</code> refuses to analyse them. All these functions
expect dissimilarities, and giving something else (like
correlations) probably is a user error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betadisper</code> uses restricted permutation of the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> uses <code>monoMDS</code> as its default ordination
engine. Function gains new argument <code>engine</code> that can be used
to alternatively select <code>MASS::isoMDS</code>.  The default is not
to use <code>stepacross</code> with <code>monoMDS</code> because its
&lsquo;weak&rsquo; tie treatment can cope with tied maximum
dissimilarities of one. However, <code>stepacross</code> is the default
with <code>isoMDS</code> because it cannot handle adequately these tied
maximum dissimilarities.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specaccum</code> gained <code>predict</code> method which uses
either linear or spline interpolation for data between observed
points. Extrapolation is possible with spline interpolation, but
may make little sense.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specpool</code> can handle missing values or empty factor
levels in the grouping factor <code>pool</code>.  Now also checks that
the length of the <code>pool</code> matches the number of
observations.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDSrotate</code> was replaced with <code>MDSrotate</code>
that can also handle the results of <code>monoMDS</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>permuted.index2</code> and other &ldquo;new&rdquo; permutation
code was removed in favour of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This code
was not intended for normal use, but packages depending on that
code in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> should instead depend on <span class="pkg">permute</span>.
</p>
</ul>
  
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>treeheight</code> uses much snappier code. The results
should be unchanged.
</p>
</ul>
